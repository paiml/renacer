**Version:** 2.0.0 (Toyota Way Revision)
**Status:** Specification - Revised for Kaizen Principles
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-16
**Reviewers:** Expert Systems Engineer (Toyota Way Methodology)

---

## Executive Summary

**Renacer** (Spanish: "to be reborn") is a next-generation binary inspection and tracing framework built in pure Rust. Following Toyota Way principles of focused excellence, Renacer's **core mission is to be the definitive system call tracer for Rust developers**, providing source-aware tracing that correlates syscalls with Rust source code via DWARF debugging information.

**Project Identity:** Renacer is first and foremost a **Rust-native strace replacement**. WASM analysis, async runtime profiling, and multi-language support are important extensions, but they are built atop a rock-solid foundation of Rust binary inspection.

### Key Differentiators (Version 1.0 MVP)

- **Source-Aware Tracing for Rust:** Correlates system calls with Rust source code, DWARF debugging information, and function contexts
- **Memory Safety:** Pure Rust implementation eliminates entire classes of vulnerabilities present in C-based tracers
- **Performance Competitive with strace:** Targets 2-5x improvement through careful engineering (ptrace baseline), with eBPF backend as future optimization
- **Extreme TDD:** 90%+ code coverage with mutation testing and property-based testing via [paiml-mcp-agent-toolkit](https://github.com/paiml/paiml-mcp-agent-toolkit)
- **Modern Developer Experience:** JSON output, syntax highlighting, integration with Rust ecosystem tools

### Future Vision (Post-1.0)

- **WASM Deep Inspection:** Security analysis and runtime profiling (requires stable 1.0 tracer core)
- **Async Runtime Awareness:** Tokio task attribution (experimental, high-risk feature)
- **Multi-Language Support:** Ruby (ruchy) and other language runtimes
- **eBPF Backend:** Sub-microsecond overhead production tracing (requires kernel 5.10+)

## 1. Etymology and Project Identity

### Name: Renacer

**Spanish Translation:**
- **Renacido** (adjective): Reborn
- **Renacer** (verb): To be reborn

**Project Symbolism:**
Renacer represents a rebirth of binary inspection tools, transcending the limitations of legacy C-based tracers like strace, ltrace, and ptrace. Just as the phoenix rises from ashes with new capabilities, Renacer emerges with modern Rust safety guarantees, WASM-native support, and performance beyond traditional tools.

---

## 2. Toyota Way Principles Applied

This specification has been revised following the Toyota Way methodology, which emphasizes:

### Principle 1: Challenge (Long-Term Philosophy)

**Original Risk:** The initial specification attempted to build an all-in-one observability platform combining strace, perf, gdb, WASM analyzer, and async profiler. This overreach risked delivering nothing well.

**Toyota Way Resolution:**
- **Vertical-First Strategy:** Build a best-in-class `strace` replacement for Rust developers (1.0 MVP)
- **Core Identity:** Renacer is a *tracer*, not an observability platform (that's Trueno's role)
- **Radial Expansion:** WASM, async, and multi-language support are post-1.0 modules built on a proven foundation

**Result:** Clear product focus that delivers high-impact value early and enables sustainable long-term growth.

### Principle 2: Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)

**Original Risk:** Waterfall implementation phases assumed the Month 1 architecture would be perfect for Month 7 challenges (unlikely).

**Toyota Way Resolution:**
- **Iterative Sprints:** 2-week cycles delivering working software and validating assumptions
- **Tight Feedback Loops:** Build ptrace backend → test performance → *then* design eBPF backend based on learnings
- **Constant Validation:** Every sprint produces a usable `renacer` binary, even if feature-limited

**Result:** Architecture evolves based on reality, not initial guesses. Reduced risk of late-stage rewrites.

### Principle 3: Genchi Genbutsu (Go and See)

**Original Risk:** Unchallenged assumptions about async runtime parsing, eBPF overhead, and WASM homogeneity.

**Toyota Way Resolution:**

1. **Async Runtime Inspection:**
   - **Reality Check:** Tokio internals are unstable. Memory scraping is brittle. `tokio-console` requires deep integration.
   - **Honest Assessment:** Marked as **experimental, high-risk, post-1.0 feature**
   - **Alternative Approach:** Leverage `tracing` crate events if available, or defer entirely to specialized tools

2. **eBPF Performance Claims:**
   - **Reality Check:** eBPF eliminates context switches but introduces ring buffer costs. At 1M syscalls/sec, userspace processing is the bottleneck.
   - **Honest Targets:** `<5%` overhead is a *benchmark goal*, not a guarantee. Depends on syscall frequency and analysis complexity.
   - **Validation Plan:** Every sprint measures overhead on realistic workloads (nginx, rustc builds)

3. **WASM Multi-Toolchain Complexity:**
   - **Reality Check:** WASM from C++ (Emscripten) differs vastly from Rust (wasm32-unknown-unknown). DWARF may be absent or inconsistent.
   - **Mitigation:** Design WASM analyzer with pluggable toolchain adapters. Test against Rust, C, C++, AssemblyScript targets.

**Result:** Specification grounded in reality with honest risk disclosure.

### Principle 4: Jidoka (Build Quality In)

**Original Strength:** 90%+ coverage, mutation testing, property-based testing via paiml-mcp-agent-toolkit.

**Toyota Way Enhancements:**
- **Continuous Fuzzing:** All parsers (ELF, DWARF, WASM) under `cargo-fuzz` in CI/CD
- **Mutation Testing Cadence:** Full runs nightly, targeted runs on PR changesets (not blocking pre-commit)
- **Formal Verification:** Explore verification of eBPF programs using research from POPL 2021 (see Section 12)

**Result:** World-class quality assurance catching defects at design time, not production.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

Traditional binary tracing tools face several critical limitations:

1. **Performance Overhead:**
   - `strace` incurs 2-100x slowdown due to ptrace context switches
   - Trapless instrumentation remains an open research problem
   - No native support for async/await runtime inspection

2. **Limited Context:**
   - System calls shown without source code correlation
   - No semantic understanding of high-level language constructs
   - Poor support for WASM and modern runtime environments

3. **Safety and Security:**
   - C-based tools vulnerable to memory safety issues
   - Limited sandboxing capabilities
   - No formal verification of instrumentation correctness

4. **WASM Inspection Gap:**
   - Existing tools don't understand WASM module semantics
   - No correlation between WASM and original source languages
   - Limited security analysis capabilities

### Target Use Cases

- **Performance Engineering:** Identify syscall bottlenecks in production Rust applications
- **Security Analysis:** Detect anomalous behavior in WASM modules and sandboxed environments
- **Debugging:** Trace execution flow with full source context for Rust, WASM, and Ruby
- **Compliance:** Audit system call behavior for regulatory requirements
- **Education:** Teach systems programming with modern, safe tooling

---

## 4. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals (1.0 MVP)

#### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Pure Rust Implementation:** Zero C dependencies, leveraging `nix`, `libc`, and safe abstractions
- ✅ **strace Feature Parity:** All major strace features (attach, follow forks, filtering, statistics)
- ✅ **Enhanced Output:** Source file:line correlation for Rust binaries via DWARF
- ✅ **Modern Developer Experience:** JSON output, colored terminal output, integration with `cargo`

#### Performance (Realistic Targets)
- ✅ **Competitive with strace:** 2-5x faster than strace on typical workloads through careful Rust optimization
- ✅ **Ptrace Baseline:** Initial 1.0 uses ptrace (proven, portable, well-understood)
- ✅ **Low Impact on Traced Process:** <20% overhead on syscall-heavy workloads (comparable to optimized strace)

#### Quality
- ✅ **90%+ Code Coverage:** Enforced via paiml-mcp-agent-toolkit
- ✅ **Mutation Testing:** Detect untested code paths (nightly runs, not blocking)
- ✅ **Property-Based Testing:** Validate invariants with proptest/quickcheck
- ✅ **Continuous Fuzzing:** All binary parsers under `cargo-fuzz`
- ✅ **Continuous Quality Gates:** Pre-commit hooks, CI/CD integration

### Goals (Post-1.0 Extensions)

- **eBPF Backend:** <5% overhead on production workloads (kernel 5.10+, x86_64/aarch64 only)
- **WASM Analysis:** Static analysis and runtime profiling of WASM modules
- **Async Runtime Support:** Experimental Tokio task attribution (requires opt-in instrumentation)
- **Multi-Language:** Ruby (ruchy), Python, other runtimes

### Non-Goals (Explicit Boundaries)

- ❌ **GUI Interface:** CLI-first design (TUI may be future work)
- ❌ **Windows Native Support:** Linux-first (WASM static analysis is cross-platform)
- ❌ **Kernel Module:** Userspace-only with eBPF for privileged operations
- ❌ **Backward Compatibility with strace CLI:** Similar but not identical flags
- ❌ **Real-Time Guarantees:** Best-effort tracing, not for hard real-time systems
- ❌ **Observability Platform:** Renacer is a tracer; Trueno handles correlation/visualization

---

## 5. Risk Analysis and Assumptions

This section documents critical assumptions and their mitigation strategies, following Genchi Genbutsu principles.

### High-Risk Areas

#### Risk 1: DWARF Correlation Accuracy in Optimized Code

**Assumption:** DWARF `.debug_line` information accurately maps instruction addresses to source locations.

**Reality:**
- Compiler optimizations (inlining, loop unrolling, dead code elimination) distort source mapping
- Aggressive optimization (`-C opt-level=3`) may produce DWARF with gaps or incorrect line numbers
- Debuginfo quality varies by compiler version (rustc, clang, gcc)

**Mitigation:**
- Test against Rust binaries built with `-C opt-level=0,1,2,3` and `-C debuginfo=1,2`
- Detect and flag low-confidence mappings (e.g., wide instruction ranges for single source line)
- Provide `--best-effort-source` flag with clear warnings about optimization-induced inaccuracy
- Document recommended build flags for best tracing experience

**Success Criteria:**
- 95%+ accuracy on `-C opt-level=1 -C debuginfo=2` (standard debug builds)
- 80%+ accuracy on `-C opt-level=2` (documented as "expected degradation")

#### Risk 2: eBPF Backend Performance Claims

**Assumption:** eBPF eliminates ptrace overhead, achieving <5% impact.

**Reality:**
- eBPF removes context switch overhead *but*:
  - Ring buffer draining has CPU cost (userspace processing)
  - DWARF lookups per syscall can dominate at high syscall rates
  - Kernel eBPF verifier may reject complex programs
- Performance depends on workload:
  - Syscall-heavy: `ls -R /` → eBPF wins decisively
  - Compute-heavy: `ffmpeg` → overhead unmeasurable regardless of backend
  - Mixed: `nginx` → results vary (network syscalls, epoll storms)

**Mitigation:**
- **Test Before Claiming:** Implement eBPF backend, benchmark against strace/ptrace on nginx, rustc, ripgrep
- **Document Reality:** Publish honest benchmarks with workload characteristics
- **Adaptive Mode:** Auto-select backend based on measured syscall frequency
- **Conservative Claims:** Advertise "2-5x faster than strace" (achievable), not "near-zero overhead" (misleading)

**Validation Plan:**
- Sprint 8-10: Implement eBPF backend
- Sprint 10: Benchmark suite with statistical rigor (criterion)
- Sprint 11: Update docs with measured overhead, not projected

#### Risk 3: Async Runtime Inspection Brittleness

**Assumption:** Parse Tokio internal state to attribute syscalls to async tasks.

**Reality:**
- Tokio internals are **not a stable API** (can change in minor versions)
- Requires either:
  - **Memory Scraping:** Brittle, unsafe, breaks with struct layout changes
  - **Instrumentation:** Requires application to use `tokio-console` or custom tracing hooks
- `tokio-console` demonstrates this is possible *with application cooperation*

**Mitigation:**
- **De-prioritize for 1.0:** Mark as experimental post-1.0 feature
- **Opt-In Model:** Only works if application uses `tracing` subscriber or `tokio-console`
- **Graceful Degradation:** Show raw epoll/io_uring if task context unavailable
- **Alternative:** Partner with Tokio team for stable introspection API (multi-year effort)

**1.0 Deliverable:**
- Document *how* async syscalls appear without task context
- Provide guide for using `tracing` crate to add manual context

#### Risk 4: WASM Toolchain Heterogeneity

**Assumption:** WASM modules have uniform structure and DWARF availability.

**Reality:**
- **Rust → WASM:** Excellent DWARF support with recent rustc
- **C/C++ → WASM (Emscripten):** DWARF may be incomplete or Emscripten-specific format
- **AssemblyScript, TinyGo:** Varying debug info quality
- **Hand-written WAT:** No debug info

**Mitigation:**
- **Pluggable Toolchain Adapters:** Design WASM analyzer with abstraction layer
- **Test Matrix:** Validate against binaries from Rust, C (clang), C++ (emscripten), AssemblyScript
- **Graceful Degradation:** Static analysis works even without DWARF; source correlation is best-effort

**1.0 Scope Reduction:**
- WASM support is **post-1.0** (allows time to handle toolchain diversity)
- Initial release focuses on Rust-to-WASM (most debuginfo-complete)

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### Risk 5: Multi-Architecture Support Complexity

**Goal:** Support x86_64, aarch64, RISC-V.

**Reality:**
- Syscall numbers differ per architecture (e.g., `open` is 2 on x86_64, doesn't exist on aarch64)
- Register conventions vary (syscall args in different registers)
- eBPF availability varies (RISC-V support is kernel 5.13+, less mature)

**Mitigation:**
- **1.0 Focus:** x86_64 and aarch64 only (cover 99% of Linux deployments)
- **Syscall Tables:** Use `syscalls` crate or generate from kernel headers
- **Architecture Abstraction:** Clean separation in code (arch-specific modules)
- **Testing:** GitHub Actions matrix builds on x86_64 and aarch64 (via QEMU)

## 5. Core Features

### 5.1 Enhanced strace Capabilities

#### Basic Tracing
```bash
# Trace a command
renacer -- ./my-rust-app

# Attach to running process
renacer -p 1234

# Follow forks
renacer -f -- ./multi-process-app
```

#### Filtering and Statistics
```bash
# Only show file I/O syscalls
renacer -e trace=file -- ./app

# Show syscall statistics
renacer -c -- ./app

# Time each syscall
renacer -T -- ./app
```

### 5.2 Source Code Correlation

**Example Output:**
```
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY) = 3
  ↳ src/auth/user.rs:42  fn load_user_database()

read(3, "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n", 4096) = 1834
  ↳ src/auth/user.rs:45  while let Ok(n) = file.read(&mut buf) {

close(3) = 0
  ↳ src/auth/user.rs:52  } // file dropped here
```

**Implementation:**
- Parse DWARF `.debug_line` section
- Map instruction pointer to source location
- Cache mappings for performance
- Support for inlined functions and optimized code

### 5.3 WASM Deep Inspection

#### Module Analysis
```bash
# Analyze WASM binary
renacer wasm analyze module.wasm

# Output:
# Module: module.wasm
# Imports:
#   - wasi_snapshot_preview1::fd_write (func)
#   - wasi_snapshot_preview1::fd_read (func)
# Exports:
#   - memory (memory, 17 pages)
#   - _start (func, index 42)
# Functions: 127
# Data Segments: 3 (total 45KB)
```

#### Runtime Tracing
```bash
# Trace WASM execution with wasmtime
renacer wasm trace -- wasmtime run module.wasm

# Output shows:
# - WASM function calls with original source mapping
# - Host function imports (WASI syscalls)
# - Memory access patterns
# - Execution time per function
```

#### Security Analysis
```bash
# Check capability usage
renacer wasm security module.wasm

# Output:
# ⚠️  Uses ambient authority:
#   - WASI fd_write (can write to any inherited FD)
#   - WASI path_open (can open arbitrary paths)
#
# Recommendation: Run with --dir=/sandboxed/path
```

**Implementation:**
- Parse WASM binary format with `wasmparser`
- Hook `wasmtime` runtime for execution tracing
- Analyze import graphs for capability propagation
- Detect unsafe patterns (unbounded loops, OOB access attempts)

### 5.4 Async Runtime Inspection

**Challenge:** Traditional tracers see async as a soup of epoll/io_uring syscalls without task context.

**Renacer's Approach:**
- Parse Tokio/async-std runtime metadata
- Track task creation and scheduling
- Attribute syscalls to logical async tasks

**Example Output:**
```
Task[#42] tokio::spawn @ src/server.rs:67
  ├─ epoll_wait([...]) = 5 events
  │   ↳ async block @ src/server.rs:68
  ├─ read(sock=10, buf, 8192) = 1024
  │   ↳ TcpStream::read @ src/server.rs:70
  └─ write(sock=10, response, 512) = 512
      ↳ TcpStream::write @ src/server.rs:75
```

### 5.5 Ruchy Ruby VM Support

**Integration with [ruchy](https://github.com/oxidize-rb/ruchy):**
- Trace Ruby method calls alongside syscalls
- Correlate Ruby source with system-level operations
- Profile Ruby C extension behavior

**Example:**
```
[Ruby] User#authenticate @ app/models/user.rb:23
  └─ openat("/etc/pam.d/common-auth", O_RDONLY) = 5
      ↳ triggered by PAM C extension
```

---

## 6. Performance Characteristics

### Optimization Strategy

#### 1. Trapless Tracing (eBPF)
**Research Foundation:** "Eliminating eBPF Tracing Overhead on Untraced Processes" (USENIX eBPF Workshop 2024)

- Use eBPF kprobes/tracepoints instead of ptrace where possible
- Eliminates context switch overhead
- **Target:** <1% overhead for syscall-heavy workloads

**Implementation:**
```rust
// eBPF program (kernel space)
SEC("tracepoint/raw_syscalls/sys_enter")
int trace_syscall_entry(struct trace_event_raw_sys_enter *ctx) {
    u64 pid_tgid = bpf_get_current_pid_tgid();
    // ... record syscall in ring buffer
}
```

#### 2. SIMD-Accelerated Processing
**Research Foundation:** "FetchBPF: Customizable Prefetching Policies in Linux with eBPF" (USENIX ATC 2024)

- Use AVX2/NEON for log parsing and filtering
- Vectorized string matching for syscall name resolution

**Example:**
```rust
use std::arch::x86_64::*;

// Process 32 syscall numbers in parallel
unsafe fn batch_resolve_syscalls(syscall_ids: &[i32; 32]) -> [&'static str; 32] {
    // SIMD lookup in syscall name table
}
```

#### 3. Lock-Free Data Structures
**Research Foundation:** "ALPS: Workload-Aware Scheduling for Serverless Functions" (USENIX ATC 2024)

- Use `crossbeam` MPMC channels for syscall event buffering
- Avoid mutex contention in multi-threaded tracing

#### 4. Zero-Copy Techniques
- `io_uring` for reading tracee memory
- `splice()` for efficient log file I/O
- `memfd` for shared memory between tracer and UI

### Benchmark Targets

| Workload | strace Overhead | Renacer Target | Measurement |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| `ls -R /usr` (syscall-heavy) | 50-100x | <2x | Wall clock time |
| `ffmpeg` (compute-heavy) | 5-10x | <1.05x | Frame processing rate |
| `nginx` (production web) | 20-30% latency | <5% latency | p99 request latency |
| WASM module analysis | N/A | <100ms | Module parsing + analysis |

---

## 7. Quality Assurance Strategy

    use proptest::prelude::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_syscall_name_resolution() {
        assert_eq!(resolve_syscall(0), "read");
        assert_eq!(resolve_syscall(1), "write");
    }

    proptest! {
        #[test]
        fn test_dwarf_line_mapping_invariants(
            address in 0x400000u64..0x500000u64
        ) {
            let result = map_address_to_source(address);
            // Property: If mapping exists, line number must be positive
            if let Some(loc) = result {
                prop_assert!(loc.line > 0);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- WASM module parsing with known-good binaries

#### End-to-End Tests (5% of tests)
- Trace real Rust applications and compare output with strace
- Profile WASM modules and verify security findings
- Load testing with concurrent tracers

### Continuous Fuzzing (Toyota Way Enhancement)

**Critical Attack Surfaces:** All binary parsers are fuzzed continuously to detect memory safety violations, panics, and logic errors.

#### Fuzz Targets

1. **ELF Parser (`fuzz_elf_parser`)**
   ```rust
   // fuzz/fuzz_targets/elf_parser.rs
   #![no_main]
   use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;
   use renacer::binary::parse_elf;

   fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
       let _ = parse_elf(data); // Must not crash or leak memory
   });
   ```

2. **DWARF Parser (`fuzz_dwarf_line_info`)**
   - Test malformed `.debug_line` sections
   - Validate address mapping never returns invalid source locations

3. **WASM Parser (`fuzz_wasm_module`)** (Post-1.0)
   - Test against malicious WASM binaries
   - Ensure security analysis never panics on crafted inputs

#### Fuzzing Infrastructure

**Continuous Fuzzing:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/fuzz.yml
name: Continuous Fuzzing
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Nightly

jobs:
  fuzz:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        target: [elf_parser, dwarf_line_info, syscall_decoder]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install cargo-fuzz
        run: cargo install cargo-fuzz
      - name: Run fuzzer (24 hours)
        run: |
          cargo fuzz run ${{ matrix.target }} -- -max_total_time=86400
      - name: Upload crash artifacts
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: fuzz-crashes-${{ matrix.target }}
          path: fuzz/artifacts/
```

**Local Fuzzing:**
```bash
# Run fuzz target for 60 seconds (developer workflow)
cargo fuzz run elf_parser -- -max_total_time=60

# Check coverage
cargo fuzz coverage elf_parser
```

**Success Criteria:**
- **Zero Crashes:** All fuzz targets run crash-free for 24 hours
- **Coverage:** Fuzz inputs reach 80%+ of parser code paths
- **Corpus Diversity:** Maintain corpus of 1000+ unique inputs per target

### Continuous Integration

**Pre-commit Hooks (Revised for Developer Experience):**
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:

## 10. Iterative Implementation Sprints (Toyota Way Kaizen)

This section replaces the waterfall "Phase 1-6" approach with iterative 2-week sprints that deliver value and validate assumptions continuously.

### Sprint Structure

- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Cadence:** Sprint planning → Implementation → Demo → Retrospective
- **Validation:** Every sprint produces a working `renacer` binary (even if feature-limited)
- **Metrics:** Test coverage, performance overhead, strace compatibility

### 1.0 MVP Roadmap (6 Months, 12 Sprints)

#### Sprint 1-2: Minimal Viable Tracer
**Goal:** `renacer -- ./hello-world` works

**Deliverables:**
- Minimal CLI (`clap`) accepting `-- COMMAND`
- Ptrace attach to child process (x86_64 only)
- Intercept `write` syscall only
- Print to stdout: `write(1, "Hello\n", 6) = 6`

**Validation:**
- Compare output with `strace -e write ./hello-world`
- Zero crashes on 100 test programs

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Proves ptrace fundamentals work
- Early feedback on Rust `nix` crate ergonomics

#### Sprint 3-4: Full Syscall Coverage
**Goal:** Trace all syscalls, not just `write`

**Deliverables:**
- Syscall number → name resolution for x86_64 Linux (use `syscalls` crate)
- Decode common syscall arguments (`openat`, `read`, `close`, `mmap`)
- Handle process exit gracefully

**Validation:**
- `renacer -- ls -la` output matches `strace` structurally
- Measure overhead: target <2x slowdown vs. strace

**Assumption Tested:**
- Is Rust ptrace wrapper performance acceptable?

#### Sprint 5-6: DWARF Integration (Rust Source Correlation)
**Goal:** Show source file:line for Rust binaries

**Deliverables:**
- Parse ELF + DWARF `.debug_line` section with `gimli`
- Map syscall instruction pointer → source location
- Enhanced output: `openat(...) = 3  ↳ src/main.rs:42`

**Validation:**
- Test against Rust binaries at `-C opt-level=0,1,2`
- Measure accuracy: 95%+ for opt-level=1
- Performance: DWARF lookup adds <10% overhead

**Assumption Tested:**
- Is DWARF accuracy acceptable on optimized code?
- Does caching strategy work?

#### Sprint 7-8: Multi-Architecture Support
**Goal:** Add aarch64 support

**Deliverables:**
- Architecture-specific syscall tables (x86_64, aarch64)
- Register mapping abstraction (syscall args in different registers)
- CI matrix testing (QEMU for aarch64)

**Validation:**
- aarch64 binary tests pass (via GitHub Actions QEMU)
- Code coverage remains >90%

#### Sprint 9-10: Advanced Features & Polish
**Goal:** Feature parity with strace core functionality

**Deliverables:**
- `-p PID` attach to running process
- `-f` follow forks/clones
- `-e trace=FILE` filtering
- `-c` statistics mode
- `-T` timing per syscall
- `-o FILE` output redirection
- `--format json` structured output

**Validation:**
- Pass 90% of strace compatibility test suite
- JSON schema documented and stable

#### Sprint 11-12: Hardening & 1.0 Release
**Goal:** Production-ready release

**Deliverables:**
- 90%+ test coverage (enforced by CI)
- Fuzz all parsers for 24 hours (zero crashes)
- Benchmark suite: publish overhead vs. strace
- Documentation: README, quickstart, man page
- Crate publication to crates.io

**Validation:**
- Security review (internal or external audit)
- Performance benchmark: 2-5x faster than strace on `ls -R /usr`
- Adoption: 3+ users/projects using in production (beta testing)

**1.0 Release Criteria:**
- ✅ All quality gates pass (coverage, mutation score, fuzz)
- ✅ Published benchmarks show competitive performance
- ✅ Documentation complete (API docs, tutorials)
- ✅ Zero known security vulnerabilities

---

## 11. Future Roadmap (Post-1.0)

The following features are intentionally deferred to build a stable foundation first.

### 1.1: eBPF Backend (3 Months)

**Sprints 13-18:**

- **Sprint 13-14:** eBPF program for `sys_enter`/`sys_exit` tracepoints
- **Sprint 15:** Ring buffer design for high-volume syscall events
- **Sprint 16:** Userspace consumer with lock-free queues
- **Sprint 17:** Benchmark eBPF vs. ptrace on nginx, rustc
- **Sprint 18:** Auto-select backend based on kernel version + workload

**Success Criteria:**
- <5% overhead on nginx (p99 latency)
- Faster than `bpftrace` on syscall-heavy workloads
- Graceful fallback to ptrace on old kernels (<5.10)

**Risk:** eBPF verifier may reject complex programs → iterate on simplification

### 1.2: WASM Static Analysis (2 Months)

**Sprints 19-22:**

- **Sprint 19:** WASM binary parser (`wasmparser` crate)
- **Sprint 20:** Security policy checker (capability analysis)
- **Sprint 21:** Multi-toolchain support (Rust, C, Emscripten)
- **Sprint 22:** CLI: `renacer wasm analyze module.wasm`

**Success Criteria:**
- Parse 1000+ public WASM modules (e.g., from npm)
- Detect known vulnerable patterns (OWASP WASM top 10)

### 1.3: Async Runtime Support (Experimental, 2 Months)

**Sprints 23-26:**

- **Sprint 23:** Prototype: consume `tracing` events if available
- **Sprint 24:** Attribute syscalls to Tokio tasks (opt-in)
- **Sprint 25:** Documentation on limitations (fragile, unstable)
- **Sprint 26:** Mark feature as `--experimental-async`

**Success Criteria:**
- Works with Tokio applications using `tokio-console`
- Graceful degradation without instrumentation
- Documented as "experimental, not for production"

**Risk:** High brittleness → may be deprecated if Tokio doesn't provide stable API

### 1.4: Ecosystem Integrations

- **Trueno Export:** Sprint 27-28 (structured trace format)
- **Ruchy Ruby Tracing:** Sprint 29-30 (VM hooks)
- **OpenTelemetry:** Sprint 31 (span export)

---

## 12. Integration with Trueno and Ruchy (Post-1.0)

### Trueno Integration
**Repository:** https://github.com/paiml/trueno (assumed)

**Trueno** is referenced as a performance correlation tool. Renacer will:
- Export trace data in Trueno-compatible format
- Correlate syscall latency with application-level metrics
- Provide joint flame graphs (syscalls + app profiling)

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Capture trace with Renacer
renacer --export-trueno trace.json -- ./my-app

# Analyze with Trueno
trueno analyze trace.json --flamegraph output.svg
```

### Ruchy Integration
**Repository:** https://github.com/oxidize-rb/ruchy

**Ruchy** is a Ruby interpreter written in Rust. Renacer will:
- Hook into Ruchy's VM to trace Ruby method calls
- Correlate Ruby stack frames with syscalls
- Profile C extension behavior

**Example:**
```bash
# Trace Ruby app running on Ruchy
renacer ruchy trace -- my_script.rb

# Output:
# [Ruby] File.read("/etc/hosts")
#   ├─ src/lib.rs:234 (Ruchy::VM::call_method)
#   └─ openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/hosts", O_RDONLY) = 3
#       ↳ Ruby stdlib (io.c:1234)
```

**Implementation:**
- Ruchy exposes VM hooks via FFI or proc-macro instrumentation
- Renacer subscribes to method call events
- Events merged with syscall timeline
